Description
This project demonstrates clustering data into groups using the K-Means algorithm. It includes an API for clustering and a Streamlit app where users can input data to find the appropriate cluster. The dataset includes the following features:

Annual Income (k$)
Spending Score (1-100)
The API is deployed using FastAPI, while Streamlit provides a user-friendly interface for submitting data and retrieving cluster information.

Requirements
To set up and run this project, youâ€™ll need the following Python packages:

fastapi
uvicorn
scikit-learn
pandas
joblib
numpy
streamlit
You can install these dependencies by running:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up and run the project.

Train and Save Model
Train the K-Means model using Scikit-Learn and save to file for deployment:

python k_means_model.py
This will create the model.pkl file in the model/ directory.

Deploy FastAPI The FastAPI application (api.py) loads the saved model and provides an endpoint for predictions. Run it using uvicorn:
uvicorn api:app --reload
This will start the FastAPI server at http://127.0.0.1:8000

Run Streamlit The Streamlit app allows users to input values and retrieve predictions from the FastAPI server. To start Streamlit, run:
streamlit run app.py
The Streamlit app will open in a browser window at http://localhost:8501.

Usage
FastAPI Endpoints API Image

POST /predict
Description: Returns the predicted cluster (Prudent Spender,Generous Spender, Extravagant Spender, Wise Spender, Loose Spender) for the input data.
Input JSON:
{
  "annual_income": 18,
  "spending_score": 72
}
Output JSON:
{
  "cluster": "Extravagant Spender"
}
Streamlit Application
The Streamlit app provides an interface for users to input feature values and get predictions. When the Predict button is clicked, the app sends the data to the FastAPI server and displays the grouping.

Example Input and Output
Example Input:

Annual Income = 18 Spending Score = 72

Example Output:

Prediction: Extravagant Spender
